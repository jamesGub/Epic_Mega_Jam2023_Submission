***Welcome to the repository for our Epic Mega Jam 2023 submission, Osiris Last Mission!***

***Check out our initial release HERE: https://llermy.itch.io/osiris-last-mission (patched version in progress!) **

Here you will find all the details of our project created in Unreal Engine 5! We managed commits and the project directly from Unreal Engine and were able to effectively work together via GitHub, without it, this project may not have happened! Regardless, all the assets, information, and history of our development is here, so take a look around!
